# Fish Farm Management Module for Odoo 18

## 💡 Overview

This Odoo 18 module (`fish_farm_management`) provides a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution specifically tailored for the unique operations and management needs of a modern fish farm. It integrates various core ERP functionalities to streamline processes from the initial stocking of fingerlings to final sales and advanced analytics, aiming for a highly configurable and future-proof system.

**Key Features:**

- **General Financial Accounts:** Manages balance sheets, revenues, and expenses directly linked to farm operations. [cite: 1]
- **Detailed Costing:** Tracks direct and indirect costs with a hierarchical cost center structure (Farm -> Sector -> Slice -> Pond), allowing for granular cost analysis per pond and fish type. [cite: 1, 4]
- **Multi-channel Sales Management:** Supports diverse sales methods including Point of Sale (POS), agents, distribution centers, and direct sales. [cite: 1, 7] It handles electronic invoicing with VAT and manages both cash and credit sales. [cite: 7]
- **Comprehensive Purchase Management:** Oversees the entire purchasing process for all farm supplies, including fingerlings, feed, medicines, and other necessities. [cite: 1, 4]
- **Full Inventory Management:** Manages stock levels for raw materials (fingerlings, feed, medicine) and harvested products, with integrated consumption and delivery tracking. [cite: 1]
- **Supplier & Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** Keeps track of supplier [cite: 1] and customer [cite: 2] data, files, documents, purchase history, and balances. (Integration with Odoo's CRM module is recommended). [cite: 2]
- **Human Resources (HR):** Manages all HR requirements, including employee files, contracts, certificates, salary processing (with allowance and incentive regulations), personal loans, and training programs. [cite: 2]
- **Manufacturing Processes:** Designed to support a manufacturing process starting with three stages, with potential for expansion, especially for export preparation (cleaning, processing, packing). [cite: 1, 7]
- **Export Operations Management:** Facilitates processes related to exporting processed fish products. [cite: 1, 7]
- **Advanced Operational Management:**
  - **Production Planning:** Create and track seasonal production plans per pond, defining target stocking, harvest dates, and weights.
  - **Fish Health & Disease Management:** Comprehensive tracking of disease incidents, symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and mortalities.
  - **Water Quality Management:** Record and monitor key water quality parameters (pH, Oxygen, Temperature, Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, Salinity) with configurable alert thresholds.
  - **Equipment & Maintenance Management:** Integrated with Odoo's standard `maintenance` module for managing farm equipment, scheduling preventive maintenance, and tracking corrective repairs.
  - **Waste Management:** Basic framework for tracking waste generated from farm operations (e.g., mortalities, organic waste).
- **Growth Modeling & Measurement:**
  - **Fish Growth Models:** Define standard growth curves for different fish types based on initial/target weights and days.
  - **Growth Measurements:** Record actual sample measurements from ponds to refine growth estimations.
- **Batch Traceability:** Provides end-to-end traceability of production batches from fingerling stocking through feeding, health management, harvesting, and sales. It calculates key batch metrics like FCR (Feed Conversion Ratio) and Survival Rate.
- **Advanced Analytics & Reporting:**
  - **Interactive Dashboard:** A custom-built dashboard displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) and interactive charts for a quick overview of farm operations (costs, harvest, pond status, alerts).
  - **Custom Report Generation Wizard:** A flexible wizard allowing users to generate detailed PDF and Excel reports for Cost Analysis, Harvest Performance, Supplies Consumption, Fish Health & Water Quality, and Sales & Profitability, based on various filters (date range, pond, fish type, etc.).
- **Configurable Settings:** Manage critical parameters such as water quality thresholds, performance warning levels (FCR, survival rate), and sorting tolerances directly from the Odoo UI.
- **Multilingual Support:** Fully translatable interface (Arabic & English) with language auto-switch based on user preference.
- **Integration Capabilities:**
  - API for seamless data exchange with other web applications. [cite: 2]
  - Recommended integration with social media platforms. [cite: 3]
  - Automation integration with tools like N8N. [cite: 3]
  - Future-ready for IoT integration (sensors) and GPS tracking for distribution.

## 🚀 Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    # Clone the main module
    git clone [https://github.com/your-organization/fish_farm_management.git](https://github.com/your-organization/fish_farm_management.git) /path/to/your/odoo/custom_addons/fish_farm_management
    # Clone the product extension module (dependency)
    git clone [https://github.com/your-organization/fish_farm_product_extension.git](https://github.com/your-organization/fish_farm_product_extension.git) /path/to/your/odoo/custom_addons/fish_farm_product_extension
    ```

    _Replace `/path/to/your/odoo/custom_addons/` with the actual path to your Odoo custom addons directory._

2.  **External Dependencies:**
    This module relies on the `xlsxwriter` Python library for Excel export functionality. For Odoo.sh environments, ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your Git repository:

    ```
    # requirements.txt
    xlsxwriter
    ```

    Commit and push this file to your Git repository. Odoo.sh will automatically install the dependency during the build process.

3.  **Add to Odoo Addons Path:**
    Ensure that your `custom_addons` directory is correctly specified in your Odoo configuration file (`odoo.conf`).

4.  **Update Odoo Modules List:**

    - Navigate to "Apps" (or "Applications") in your Odoo instance.
    - Click on "Update Apps List" (or "Update Modules List").

5.  **Install Modules:**
    - **Crucially, first install the dependency:** Search for "Fish Farm Product Extension" and click "Install".
    - **Then, install the main module:** Search for "Fish Farm Management" and click "Install".

## ⚙️ Configuration & Usage

Upon successful installation, a new top-level menu item "Fish Farm Management" will appear.

### **Getting Started:**

1.  **Module Settings:** Navigate to `Fish Farm Management > Settings` to configure water quality thresholds, performance warning limits (FCR, Survival Rate), and sorting tolerances.
2.  **Master Data:**
    - Define your `Fish Farms`, `Sectors`, `Slices`, and `Ponds` under `Fish Farm Management > Configuration`.
    - Configure `Fish Growth Models` for your specific fish types under `Fish Farm Management > Configuration`.
    - Go to Odoo's `Products` menu (or `Fish Farm Management > Configuration > Product Types`) to define your `Fish Types`, `Feed Types`, and `Medicine Types` by checking the corresponding boolean fields on each product.
    - Create and manage `Analytic Tags` for cost classification (e.g., "Pond Cost Types").
3.  **Operations:** Begin recording your daily farm operations via the `Fish Farm Management > Operations` menu, including:
    - `Fish Stocking`
    - `Pond Feeding & Supplies`
    - `Pond Costs`
    - `Harvest Records`
    - `Harvest Sorting`
    - `Fish Health Records`
    - `Water Quality Readings`
    - `Growth Measurements`
    - `Production Plans`
    - `Batch Traceability` (records are automatically created with stocking)
    - Manage your `Equipment` and `Maintenance Requests` directly or through the dedicated `Maintenance` menu.

### **Reporting:**

Access the `Fish Farm Management > Reports > Custom Reports` wizard to generate detailed PDF and Excel reports based on various filtering criteria.

## 🔗 Technical Notes

- **Dynamic List View Decorations:** List views incorporate dynamic styling based on record status or configurable thresholds (e.g., water quality alerts, pond status).
- **Centralized Settings:** Utilizes `ir.config_parameter` and `res.config.settings` for system-wide module configurations.
- **Odoo 18 Standards:** All views are defined using Odoo 18 standards (`tree` views replaced by `list` tag).
- **Custom Dashboard:** A client-side (OWL/JavaScript) dashboard component fetches data via JSON-RPC controllers and renders interactive charts using Chart.js.
- **Excel Export:** Custom HTTP controllers generate Excel reports using the `xlsxwriter` library.

## ✅ Tested On
